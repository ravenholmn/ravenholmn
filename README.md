# Projects

### Nightmariners *(Ex Co-founder, Ocean's Call Studios)*  
[Wishlist on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3325020/Nightmariners/)  
A cooperative horror game where up to 4 players navigate a ship through dangerous seas, evading terrifying sea monsters along the way. The core gameplay focuses on **carrying cargo** from point A to point B, with survival focusing on encounters with sea monsters. 🛳️🌊

### Fail Forward *(Game Jam Project)*  
[Play on Itch.io](https://kamos-dev.itch.io/fail-forward)  
A 2D platformer where **failure is a mechanic**. A platformer inspired by **Celeste**, your failed past self enable you to create new paths formerly unapproachable. 🏃‍♂️💨

### Super Cultist 64 *(Game Jam Project)*  
[Play on Itch.io](https://kamos-dev.itch.io/super-cultist-64)  
A quirky **retro 3D platformer** with dark humor and cult themes. Inspired by **Super Mario 64**, it's admittedly not the best jam project but not bad for a first jam project! (I apologize if you get stuck in the ice level.) 🎮✨
